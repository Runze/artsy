An analysis of Artsyâ€™s twitter followers

The whole project was documented in detail in my blog [here](http://www.runzemc.com/2014/05/an-analysis-of-artsys-twitter-followers.html).

All the data used are saved in the `data` folder, which includes the raw data parsed from the json file (crawled from twitter using python), the intermediary output, the shape file used for the location mapping and charting.

The output charts are sved in the `graph` folder.

Hope you like it :-)
