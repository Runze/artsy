An analysis of Artsyâ€™s twitter followers
=====

The whole project was documented in detail in my blog [here](http://www.runzemc.com/2014/05/an-analysis-of-artsys-twitter-followers.html).

All the data used are saved in the `data` folder, which includes the raw follower data parsed from the json file, the intermediary output, and the shape file used for the location mapping and charting. Note the python code for crawling the follower profiles are not included. It was adapted from the sample code provided by the book [Mining the Social Web](https://rawgit.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/master/ipynb/html/Chapter%209%20-%20Twitter%20Cookbook.html).

The output charts are sved in the `graph` folder.

Hope you will like it :-)
